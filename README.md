# Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX-Mapping

Henri here- I got a Numark Mixtrack Platinum FX, and none of the configs/mappings I found fully worked. I took the demo mode exiting code from https://github.com/istankovic/Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX and merged it onto https://github.com/ending2020/Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX-Mapping. It now works. I'll save you the pain of figuring this out, and upload the files. Feel free to contact me if you encounter issues.

To install these files, check https://manual.mixxx.org/2.3/en/chapters/controlling_mixxx.html#installing-a-mapping-from-the-forum.

Mixxx DJ Controller Mapping for Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX


Welcome to the Numark-Mixtrack-Platinum-FX-Mapping wiki!

This is a project based on the Numark Mixtrack Platinum from Matthew Nicholson. Thank you for your superb work Matthew! https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/wiki/numark_mixtrack_platinum

I'm a nooby in coding and can use all the help I can get!
Thanks!
